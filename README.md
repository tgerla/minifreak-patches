# minifreak-patches
Some custom patches for Arturia's Minifreak and Minifreak V synthesizers.

KillersPatches.mnfx: Three patches intended to sound like some of the synths from The Killers - Hot Fuss, 2004.

JennySaw - Big loud supersaw from Jenny Was A Friend Of Mine. I based this on the Giga Saw factory preset.
Midnight - Nice stringish pad from Midnight Show
ToldMe - Heavily modulated cutoff thing from Somebody Told Me

I got a lot of help from this YouTube video where someone had done some Killers covers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah0BwmB8J5g

I'm brand new to sound design so if anyone has suggestions or additional patches, I'd gladly add them to the collection. Enjoy!
